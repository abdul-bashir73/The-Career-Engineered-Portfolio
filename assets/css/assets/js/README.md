# Career-Engineered Portfolio (NJIT)

## Live Link
(After you enable GitHub Pages, paste the URL here)
- https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/

## What This Is
A CTA-first portfolio built for NJIT career presence: clear value statement, case studies (problem → approach → outcome), and a lead-gen contact flow.

## Orchestration Log (AI Correction)
The AI initially suggested a heavier stack (framework + backend), which was overkill for a portfolio and slower to deploy. I pivoted to a lightweight static site so GitHub Pages would work reliably. The AI also produced a broken link path for assets once; I fixed it by using a consistent `/assets/` structure and updating the HTML references.
