# AGENTS.md — Master Implementation Letter

## The Mandate (North Star)
Build a career-engineered portfolio site for an NJIT student targeting **NJ/NY opportunities**.
Primary goal: a visitor should understand **who I am, what I offer, and what to do next** within 5 seconds.

Target outcome:
- (Job Seeker) Earn interviews for Summer 2026 roles in high-growth sectors (ex: NYC fintech / NJ defense / analytics / PM).
OR
- (Consultant) Convert business owners into leads for automation/web solutions.

## The Tech Stack (and Why)
- Plain HTML + CSS + JavaScript
Why:
- Fast to build, easy to review, and deploys reliably on GitHub Pages
- Mobile-responsive with zero build tooling
- SEO-friendly with semantic HTML

## The Sitemap
1. Hero (above the fold)
   - Clear headline (value statement)
   - 1–2 lines of context
   - Primary CTA button
2. Case Studies
   - 2–3 cards: problem → approach → tools → outcome
3. Proof
   - Links (GitHub, LinkedIn, resume/case study)
4. Lead-Gen
   - A contact form (mailto-based) + direct email
   - CTA repeated

## Non-Negotiables
- Mobile responsiveness (works cleanly on phone)
- SEO keywords for NJ/NY and NJIT
- CTA-first experience:
  - Job seeker CTA example: “Request My Resume” / “Download Case Study”
  - Consultant CTA example: “Get a Free Automation Audit” / “Schedule a 15-min Strategy Call”
- Professional vibe: clean layout, clear sections, no clutter

## Implementation Notes
- Keep design minimal and modern.
- No backend required; use mailto for the contact form.
- Make it easy for a recruiter/client to take the next step.
